## Inspiration
On the way to HackNC, we saw a squirrel eating a bagel. Inspired by the squirrel, we decided to theme our project after the amazing discovery. 

## What it does
RocketSquirrel was created with novice coders in mind. We wanted this to be an interactive game where beginners can test their knowledge of Java while having fun.

## How we built it
We built this application with the use of Android Studio, Photoshop, and Procreate. Graphics were designed with Procreate and Photoshop. The application was designed using Android studio. The language of the code we wrote was in Java.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team was not familiar with the Android Studio although everyone was confident in the Java language. However, throughout the hackathon, everyone in the team were able to learn how to utilize Android Studio, allowing the team to collaborate thoroughly to make the final result. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to learn how to use Android Studio and make the final result. 

## What we learned
We learned how to use Android Studio as well as Photoshop. 

## What's next for RocketSquirrel: Hello World
The next step is to create program that allows more user interactions and result in the user learning more about coding.
